## What i leanerd with this project  

For the beginning, i created a script without PEP8 convention.  
Line by line without worrying about its efficiency, without any function, all raw.  
I realized that the PEP8 convention was very useful to improve the quality of my code.  
I learned to create sub-functions, each function has a specific purpose.  
Using an alternative to a While loop, learning to scrape. I also learned to exploit,  
navigate in lists and dictionaries. And also to document my script,  
so that it is clear and understandable.
